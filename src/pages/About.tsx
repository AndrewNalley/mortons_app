        <h3>Hello!</h3>
          <p>Anyone who knows me could tell you the most important thing to me is my baby boy Morton. üê∂ü©µ </p>
          <p>He is a Samoyed, almost 2 years old and the bestest boy. The second thing someone who knows me will tell you, is that I love gift giving and saving memories of a special moment. From those loves, this shop was born‚Ä¶ </p>
          <p>We started about a year ago, preserving a close friends wedding bouquet, and loved it so much!</p>

          <p>Here at Morton's Mementos, I can preserve your wedding flowers in resin, for you to cherish them forever. You can customize your pieces, with multiple different styles or bring in your favorite serving tray.</p>

          <p>Creating exactly what you want is my top priority and I can't wait to work with you and make those pieces a reality!  </p>
